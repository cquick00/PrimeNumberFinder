# Python Prime Number Finder

## **Purpose**

- The purpose of this project is to make a simple app to look for Prime Numbers.

## **Capabilities**

- Finds primes indefinitely (it runs until you kill it with a keyboard interrupt [ctrl+c] on Windows while in terminal window)
- Gets rid of Semiprimes
- Gets rid of Squarefree Primes
- Stores found Primes in a text file called "prime_numbers.txt" (this file is pre-made and starts as empty as I didn't include code to create it)
- Stores the number that you were on before terminating the program in a file called "current_number.txt" (this file is pre-made and starts with just 2 as the value [to get the program off and running] as I didn't include code to create it)
    - This allows for starting back up where you left off and/or putting your own starting number in the file and starting from wherever YOU want to

## **Notes**
- I made this for fun in my spare time to have a crack at finding the next elusive Prime Number!
